## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow Python PEP 8 with some project-specific conventions:

```python
# Use clear, descriptive variable names
sensor_reading = await hardware.read_temperature()

# Type hints for all public functions
async def process_sensor_data(data: Dict[str, float]) -> SensorReading:
    """Process raw sensor data into structured readings."""
    pass

# Educational code should be especially clear
class EnvironmentalMonitor:
    """
    Simple environmental monitoring class for educational use.
    
    This class demonstrates basic environmental data collection
    suitable for high school and undergraduate education.
    """
```

### Code Formatting

Use automated formatting tools:

```bash
# Format code
black furcate_nano/ tests/

# Check code style
flake8 furcate_nano/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy furcate_nano/
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
# Good examples
feat(sensors): Add BME680 air quality sensor support
fix(classroom): Resolve dashboard WebSocket connection issue
docs(tutorial): Add advanced weather AI integration guide
test(hardware): Expand sensor calibration test coverage

# Message format
<type>(<scope>): <description>

# Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, style, chore
# Scope: sensors, ml, mesh, classroom, hardware, etc.
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/bme680-sensor-support
git checkout -b feature/classroom-dashboard-improvements

# Bug fix branches
git checkout -b fix/mqtt-connection-timeout
git checkout -b fix/raspberry-pi-hardware-detection

# Documentation branches

git checkout -b docs/api-reference-update
```

## Testing

### Test Categories

#### 1. Unit Tests

Test individual components in isolation:

```python
# tests/unit/test_sensors.py
import pytest
from furcate_nano.hardware import HardwareManager

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_sensor_reading_validation():
    """Test sensor reading data validation."""
    manager = HardwareManager(simulation=True)
    
    # Test valid reading
    reading = await manager.read_temperature()
    assert reading.value is not None
    assert reading.sensor_type == "temperature"
    assert reading.timestamp is not None

@pytest.mark.educational
async def test_classroom_sensor_setup():
    """Test classroom-specific sensor configurations."""
    # Educational test for classroom environments
    pass
```

#### 2. Integration Tests

Test component interactions:

```python
# tests/integration/test_ml_pipeline.py
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_complete_ml_pipeline():
    """Test end-to-end ML processing pipeline."""
    config = NanoConfig(simulation=True)
    core = FurcateNanoCore(config)
    
    # Test sensor data -> ML analysis -> results
    await core.start()
    readings = await core.hardware.read_sensors()
    results = await core.ml.analyze(readings)
    
    assert results is not None
    assert "classification" in results
```

#### 3. Educational Tests

Test educational functionality:

```python
# tests/educational/test_classroom_features.py
@pytest.mark.educational
def test_student_dashboard_safety():
    """Ensure student dashboard has appropriate safety restrictions."""
    # Test educational safety features
    pass

@pytest.mark.educational 
def test_curriculum_alignment():
    """Test NGSS curriculum alignment features."""
    # Test educational standards compliance
    pass
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
python -m pytest tests/educational/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=furcate_nano --cov-report=html

# Run educational tests only
python -m pytest -m educational

# Run tests requiring hardware
python -m pytest -m hardware --device=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Must run in simulation mode without hardware
- **Integration tests**: Can use simulation or require hardware flag
- **Educational tests**: Focus on classroom safety and usability
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage
- **Documentation**: Test all public APIs and educational features

## Documentation

### Documentation Types

#### 1. Code Documentation

```python
class SensorManager:
    """
    Manages environmental sensors for Furcate Nano devices.
    
    This class provides a unified interface for reading from various
    environmental sensors commonly used in educational and research
    environments.
    
    Attributes:
        sensors: Dictionary of configured sensor instances
        simulation: Whether to use simulated sensor data
        
    Example:
        >>> manager = SensorManager(simulation=True)
        >>> reading = await manager.read_temperature()
        >>> print(f"Temperature: {reading.value}Â°C")
    """
```

#### 2. Tutorials

Create comprehensive, educational tutorials:

```markdown
# Tutorial Structure
## Overview
## Prerequisites  
## Step-by-Step Instructions
## Code Examples
## Educational Objectives
## Assessment Questions
## Troubleshooting
## Next Steps
```

#### 3. API Documentation

Document all public APIs:

```python
async def read_sensor_data(
    sensor_type: str,
    duration_seconds: int = 60,
    interval_seconds: int = 5
) -> List[SensorReading]:
    """
    Read sensor data over a specified duration.
    
    Args:
        sensor_type: Type of sensor to read ('temperature', 'humidity', etc.)
        duration_seconds: Total reading duration in seconds
        interval_seconds: Interval between readings in seconds
        
    Returns:
        List of sensor readings with timestamps and values
        
    Raises:
        SensorNotFoundError: If specified sensor type is not available
        HardwareError: If sensor hardware communication fails
        
    Example:
        >>> readings = await read_sensor_data('temperature', 300, 10)
        >>> avg_temp = sum(r.value for r in readings) / len(readings)
    """
